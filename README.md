# Support Vector Regression (SVR)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook template for performing support vector regression (SVR), a powerful technique for modeling complex relationships between variables. The notebook guides you through the process of training and visualizing an SVR model using a dataset of position levels and salaries.

## Notebook

### Support_Vector_Regression.ipynb

This notebook covers:
- Importing necessary libraries
- Loading the dataset
- Feature scaling
- Training the SVR model on the whole dataset
- Predicting new results
- Visualizing the SVR results
- Visualizing the SVR results with higher resolution and a smoother curve

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/support-vector-regression.git
    ```

2. **Open the notebook:**
    - You can open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Usage

This template can be used as a starting point for implementing support vector regression on your datasets. Simply modify the code to fit the specific requirements of your project.

## Acknowledgments

- The initial template was automatically generated by Google Colab.

Feel free to customize and expand this notebook according to your needs. Happy coding!
